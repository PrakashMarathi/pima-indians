Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset - Logistic Regression
Overview
This repository contains code and information related to applying logistic regression on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The dataset is widely used in machine learning and statistics for practicing binary classification algorithms. The goal is to predict whether a given individual has diabetes based on certain medical attributes.

Dataset Description
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset consists of several medical parameters for Pima Indian women, along with a binary outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. The dataset includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function, a measure of the genetic influence.
Age: Age in years.
The target variable is:

Outcome: 1 if the individual has diabetes, 0 otherwise.
Logistic Regression Model
Logistic regression is a widely used classification algorithm that models the probability of an event occurring as a function of one or more predictor variables. In the context of this project, logistic regression will be applied to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on their medical attributes.
